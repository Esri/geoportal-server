# Contributing to ArcGIS Viewer for Flex

There are many ways you can contribute to the [ArcGIS Viewer for Flex](http://links.esri.com/flexviewer).

* Be active on the [forum](http://forums.arcgis.com/forums/111-ArcGIS-Viewer-for-Flex).
* Suggest enhancements on [ArcGIS Ideas](http://ideas.arcgis.com/).
* Create and share your own (custom) widgets.
* Report potential bugs to [Esri Support](http://support.esri.com/).
* Contribute to the ArcGIS Viewer for Flex source code.

This guide describes how you can contribute improvements to the ArcGIS Viewer for Flex source code.

The [ArcGIS Viewer for Flex](http://links.esri.com/flexviewer) is built by the Flex Team at [Esri](http://www.esri.com) and contributors like you. We are excited that you are interested in improving the Flex Viewer source code. This guide will help make sure your contribution (pull request) will be accepted and easily merged.

1. Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free).
2. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) the [Flex Viewer repo](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-viewer-flex/) on GitHub.
3. Clone it to your local machine.
4. Checkout the [develop branch](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-viewer-flex/tree/develop).
5. Create a new feature branch on your local machine.
    * The name of the branch doesn't matter, but as a best practice use a descriptive name like "fix-look-of-widgetgroup-hover-state".
6. Write code to add an enhancement or fix the problem.  
    * Follow the [coding conventions][1] already used in the Flex Viewer source code (spaces instead of tabs, proper indentation, use [Flex Formatter](http://sourceforge.net/projects/flexformatter/files/) along with our [Flex Formatter settings](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-viewer-flex/blob/develop/FlexFormatter.properties)).
    * Document your code.
    * Make commits of logical units.
    * Use [clear and descriptive commit messages](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).
7. Test your code.

### Submitting changes
1. Push the changes in your feature branch to your repo.
2. Submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) against the "develop" branch.  Submitting a pull request will open a GitHub issue.
    * Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce; or if an enhancement, indicate the functionality you built.
