The metadata element <i>contentType</i>  was created by ESRI to help classify metadata documents for use in ESRI software. Most metadata standards do not implement a 'contentType' element; therefore, the Geoportal Server uses information within metadata documents to attempt to assign a content type value to records. If it cannot find information to assign a content type, it will assign the document to the <i>Resource Undetermined</i> category.The icons and associated resource type are shown below.    <img purpose="img" placement="inline" alt="" title="" src="00t0/GUID-F887737A-8CAC-4FB5-9EAC-740AF4A69E2A-web.png"></li><li purpose="li" id="GUID-C9798320-819F-4DA5-A3C6-DF991A32C2EF"><b>Search Result Footprints</b>:  allows users to see what the spatial extent of the selected resource.

You can embed the REST URL in an external webpage, list it as an entry in your content management system, or subscribe to it through an RSS feed.  Any time the link is accessed, all resources published to the geoportal that meet the search criteria will be displayed.  Scroll to the bottom of the search result page and note the six REST format options: <span class="uicontrol">GEORSS</span>, <span class="uicontrol">ATOM</span>, <span class="uicontrol">HTML</span>, <span class="uicontrol">FRAGMENT</span>, <span class="uicontrol">KML</span>, and <span class="uicontrol">JSON</span>.
