It also contains tables for referenced users (users owning data within the catalog), remote repositories registered for synchronization, and saved searches per user. The geoportal will make use of the standard Java JDBC API when directly communicating with the relational database. The primary components associated with the publication of documents to the geoportal metadata catalog are depicted in the figure below.</p><p id="GUID-081CC7A4-3A68-4A5E-B681-E84B9BF438B3"><img purpose="img" placement="inline" alt="" title="" src="00t0/GUID-0569EF37-966A-4072-95F9-A38D5B1CC85E-web.png"></p><p id="GUID-21782458-B504-43AF-931C-E077CC4EFB9B">  Metadata documents that are classified as either "Approved" or "Reviewed" by an administrator will be sent to the <a class="xref" rel="00t0/00t00000003n000000.htm" href="00t0/00t00000003n000000.htm">Apache Lucene index</a> used by the geoportal. Documents stored within the index are discoverable through search. Apache Lucene implements an Analyzer during the indexing (and searching) process. The job of the Analyzer is to tokenize terms, considering language based stop words and stemming. Additional Analyzers are available through the Apache Lucene contribution community. The website has two pages exposing metadata publication end points: <ul purpose="ul" id="UL_A6B03735F2BC480EAB39209313102C54">

				</ul> The website contains a synchronization process that allows for resource document publication from the external catalogs.

The watchdog is used only in a load balanced environment to ensure the synchronization processes are coordinated. Once the queue receives resource information it acquires the resource connection information through the resource definition element and proceeds through the dedicated synchronization thread. The resource documents are either selected from the target catalog or created based on the resource information available. The output of the selection, iteration, and reading process is an xml document that will be sent through the publication request component described below. The  dedicated synchronization thread also creates a report that is visible through the geoportal user interface on the <span class="wintitle">Synchronization Report</span> page of the resource. As an option on the Create or Edit Resource page you can choose to have an e-mail of the synchronization results sent.</p><p id="GUID-D19BD68A-FF4F-44C9-AF53-3D6E970630DC">The website also exposes a REST API, allowing for compatible publication of metadata documents from client applications such as ArcCatalog.
