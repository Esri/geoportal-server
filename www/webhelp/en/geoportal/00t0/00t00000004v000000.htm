This service endpoint has the ability to generate GeoRSS, KML, ATOM, JSON, HTML and HTML fragment responses. Requests are parsed by a RestQueryParser component and executed through the SearchEngine component. Any client that can understand RSS, GeoRSS, KML, ATOM, JSON or HTML protocol can utilize this endpoint. Typical clients include: browsers, content management systems, ArcGIS Explorer, and Google Earth.

Any client that understands the CSW 2.0.2 Discovery protocol can query the catalog through this end point.
