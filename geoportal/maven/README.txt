This folder contains build scripts to create Geoportal Server JAR package 
and Geoportal Server WAR web application.

BUILD PROFILES

This projects allows to use two profiles:

1. release-profile (this is a default profile)
2. development-profile 

The release-profile will produce artifacts ready for distribution and deployment, however a 'war' application will need to be configured after deployment.

The development-profile will produce pre-configured 'war' file. This profile is usefull when working on product development with predefined configuration.
Any such configuration must be stored inside <USER_HOME_DIRECTORY>/geoportal/endorsed folder. The content of this folder retains structure of the web
application, with two most distinctive folders: WEB-INF and META-INF.

Most typically, developer would need custom logging.properties, gpt.xml and context.xml. They should be placed as follows:

<USER_HOME_DIRECTORY>/geoportal/endorsed/WEB-INF/classes/gpt/config/gpt.xml
<USER_HOME_DIRECTORY>/geoportal/endorsed/WEB-INF/classes/logging.properties
<USER_HOME_DIRECTORY>/geoportal/endorsed/META_INF/context.xml

Note! When development-profile is selected, build will fail if <USER_HOME_DIRECTORY>/geoportal/endorsed folder is absent.


BUILD INSTRUCTIONS

1. Obtain a copy of Apache Maven from http://maven.apache.org
2. Invoke the following command from geoportal/maven directory:

	mvn clean 
	mvn install 
	
	or 
	
	mvn install -P development-profile
	
Note: If running this for the first time, esri file dependencies must be installed locally, or the mvn install will fail.  Following approach described in item 1 in the Dependencies section of maven docs: http://maven.apache.org/pom.html#Dependencies

	mvn install:install-file -Dfile=../lib/arcgis_ws_runtime.jar -DgroupId=com.esri.arcgis -DartifactId=arcgis_ws_runtime -Dversion=10.5.1 -Dpackaging=jar
	mvn install:install-file -Dfile=../lib/arcgis_agsws_stubs.jar -DgroupId=com.esri.arcgis -DartifactId=arcgis_agsws_stubs -Dversion=10.5.1 -Dpackaging=jar
