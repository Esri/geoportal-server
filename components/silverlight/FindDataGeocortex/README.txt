This project is a module that can be used in Latitude Geographics' Geocortex viewer for silverlight.
It is an extension of ESRI's open source silverlight search widget for ESRI Geoportal Server.

The main function of this module is to search a geoportal server for metadata catalogue keywords. 
If the search results include URLs linking to live map data services then this module can dynamically add those map services into the layer list in the Geocortex silverlight viewer.

The original geoportal search widget code from ESRI can be found at the URL below.

This module was tested with the GeoDiscover Alberta geoportal server and map viewer provided by the Government of Alberta, Canada.
